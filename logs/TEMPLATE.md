# <session ID> — <title>

## Scope and evidence

State collection method, available context, limitations, related IDs and starting
revision. Identify uncommitted user changes present before work.

## Selected conversation

Attribute requests to the user and outcomes to the assistant. Mark exact quotes
and paraphrases explicitly. Include corrections and changes in direction.
Exclude private model state, confidential content, and irrelevant system context.

## Decisions and outcomes

State rationale, alternatives, consequences and what remains unresolved. Never
convert implementation authorization into human design sign-off.

## Commands and validation

Record relevant commands, actual exits/results, failed attempts and remedies.
Distinguish structural checks from detector acceptance.

## Changes and revision links

List changed files or refer to the paired JSON inventory. Result commits are
recorded only once they exist; Git history locates this record's enclosing commit.

## Token accounting

Record the client-provided per-turn usage source and import command, or state why
exact counters are unavailable. Report observed input/output sums and missing
coverage from `session_log.py summary`; empty usage means unknown, not zero.
Never copy raw client archives or private model state. Do not duplicate turns
across tasks or add cached/reasoning subsets to the input/output totals.

## Follow-up

List remaining work, missing measurements and any human review needed.
